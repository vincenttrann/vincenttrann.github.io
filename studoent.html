                    <p>I designed a product named "Studoent", a student based task management application that integrates ideals

                  <h4>Defining the Problem</h4>
                    <p> After reading and understanding the challenge brief, I first sought out to define and empathize the problem to give myself direction with the product design. <br> <br>
                      <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>The user base I decided to target were college and university students</span> because I was a student myself. Given the limited time frame, this would allow me to validate my 
                        research based on not only my personal experiences but also my peers' anecdotes about higher-education student life. <br><br>
                        To provide myself contextual evidence about the problem of productivity and mindfulness within college students, I came up with 3 research questions: <br><br>
                        <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>
                        1) What are the major factors that affects a student's productivity? <br>
                        2) What factors facilitate motivation within students? <br>
                        3) How can we encourage mindfulness within students?

                <div id="questions-findings" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Questions Findings</h4>
                  <p>After spending a couple of hours looking through online articles, I found the following answers to my proposed research questions:</p>
                  <p>
                      <h5>1) What are the major factors that affects a college student's productivity?</h5>
                      <p>According to <a href='https://kappanonline.org/rosen-distracted-student-mind-attention/' target='_blank'>The Distracted Student Mind</a> by Larry D. Rosen, <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>technological distractions are the single most detrimental factor in a student's productivity.</span> 
                        There is evidence that states that: </p>
                          - The typical student is distracted by technologies like phones at least 5 out of every 15 minutes they set aside to study<br> 
                          - Due to the mass amount of media consumption today, student's sub-consicously check their phones whenever a notification alerts them</p> 
                        <h5>2) What factors facilitate motivation within college students?</h5>
                        <p>According to <a href='https://www.villanovau.com/resources/student-learning/tips-for-staying-motivated-in-college/' target='_blank'>Villanova University</a> and <a href='https://fremont.edu/how-to-stay-motivated-in-college/' target='_blank'>Fremont College</a>, 
                            there are a variety of factors that play into motivating students:</p>
                        <p>
                            - Maintaining a positive attitude <br>
                            - Acknowledging past accomplishments <br>
                            - Setting flexible schedules and routines <br>
                            - Prioritizing tasks <br>
                            - Celebrating incremental successfully <br>
                            - Taking breaks to rejuvenate the mind
                        </p>
                        <h5>3) How can we encourage mindfulness within college students?</h5>
                        <p>According to <a href="https://www.affordablecollegesonline.org/college-resource-center/mindfulness-meditation/#:~:text=While%20meditation%20can%20help%20to,to%20everything%20they're%20doing" target='_blank'>A Student Guide to Going Zen</a>, 
                            mindfulness is cultivated by:</p>
                        <p>
                            - Meditation <br>

                  <h4>Comparative Analysis</h4>
                  <p>After answering the research questions, I analyzed competitors of Studoent, which were: Todoist, Trello, 
                    Notion, and Calm. 
                    <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>My goal for this comparative analysis was to identify features within these apps that facilitate productivity

                   to demonstrate the features available to the user as they navigate through
                   Studoent.

              <div id='mid-fi' class='subgroup'>
                <h4>Mid Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
                <p>
                  <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>Given the limited timeframe for this project, I chose to jump right into mid fidelity wireframes in order to increase the efficiency of my workflow.</span>
                  Taking into account the user flow, I developed the following screens:

                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/Studoent mid-fi screens@2x.png" alt="mid fidelity wireframes"><br><br>
              </div>

              <div id='hi-fi' class='subgroup'>
                <h4>High Fidelity Prototype</h4>
                  <video autoplay muted loop class='video-features-studoent'>
                    <source src='/images/Studoent high fi.mp4'>

                  <h5 class='video-feature-title-studoent'>Studoent - A college student's best friend</h5>
                  <p class='video-feature-content-studoent'>
                    Based on the user research and design methods conducted, the final prototype presents college students a way to organize a productive lifestyle, 
                    options to practice mindfulness, and an AI mentor that motivates them.
                    Studoent gives students a means to be productive and mindful, while also fitting seemlessly into their busy lives.

                <p class='small-margin-bottom'>
                  Given the time constraint of this competition, I found that I had to be flexible in how I conducted my user research. Though it is standard to conduct user interviews and surveys 
                  to collect important data on users, I decided to not use these methods due to the small sample size of data it would give me. <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>Instead, I opted for more qualitative ways of 
                  learning about the users, in tackling the problem itself.</span> By defining research questions that I would be able to learn about online, this gave me the opportunity to empathize
                  with college students, and utilize my personal experiences to validate these answers.
                  <br><br>
                  Thanks to these research questions, I was able to progress through user research by utilizing the internet once more to look at competitors and how they approach the problem of productivity
                  and mindfulness. <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>By creating personas, I found the opportunity to remedy user needs within the features that Studoent would support.</span> Even though time was limited, I was able to conduct
                  sufficient research to support and guide my design decisions.

                <h4>Self Critiques</h4>
                <p class='small-margin-bottom'>
                  Looking back at Studoent a couple of weeks later, I will find a major critique in my design in terms of both its user experience and user interface as an exercise to learn and grow.
                  <br><br>
                  <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>As for the UX, a major problem I see is the fact that there is no incentive for the user to actually engage with the "Relax" function.</span> Even though this option is
                  easily accessible, the user flow is mainly focused on productivity with mindfulness just slotted in there for convenience. <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>A solution to this problem would be to 
                  gamify the entire experience for the student.</span> By incorporating a system of earning rewards for utilizing all aspects of the app, the user will have a reason to 
                  visit the Relax feature. An example of this solution would be to give users points for each task and mindfulness exercise accomplished, and these points would be used to 
                  grant users either more customization options (like themes for the Studoent Mentor) or monetary rewards.
                  <br><br>
                  <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>As for the UI, a major problem I found is that my sense of visual hierarchy and sizing was inconsistent and causes the app to look more unappealing than it should be.</span> For one,
                  some screens, like the Dashboard screen, looks crowded due to my lack of whitespace usage. But the Task page had sufficient whitespace, which validates this 
                  inconsistency. <span class='highlight highlight-studoent'>As a remedy for this, I would want to rethink the sizing of my content "cards", in order to let the design breathe.</span> Additionally, some buttons and text were
                  way too big and took up too much screen real estate. A great example of this would be on the Settings screen, in which the "Enable Desktop Notifications" button was
                  unusually huge compared to all other aspects of the screen. Again, the user interface would look more aesthetic if I incorporated more whitespace and became more
                  consistent with sizing.
