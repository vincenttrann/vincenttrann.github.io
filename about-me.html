                <p class='small-margin-bottom'>I design with one goal in mind: To make people's lives easier. 
                  My Informatics, Human-Computer Interaction and Business background allows me to design products that prioritizes
                  user-friendly interactions but not at the expense of stakeholder's goals and requirements. My experience conducting user 
                  research has allowed me to develop empathy for many users of diverse backgrounds, giving
                  me unique insights on how to approach design problems and develop intuitive prototypes. 
                  <br> <br>
                  As the world progresses through technological innovations, I will focus on making these technologies
                  not only simple to use, but also enjoyable to use. I will impact people's lives
                  by designing with the user in mind and never striving for anything short of perfection.

                <p class='small-margin-bottom'>
                  Nice to meet you! I'm a Los Angeles based Product Designer focused on providing
                   value through user experiences. I love to learn through creative problem solving. 
                   <br> <br>
                  In 2021, I graduated from UC Irvine with 2 Bachelor's degrees: 1 in Human-Computer Interaction
                  and 1 in Business Economics. 
                  <br><br>
                  During my time in university, I worked in numerous diverse roles 
                  that facilitated my growth. From being a Marketing Agent for Welk Resorts â†’ Coding Instructor 
                  for CodingMindsAcademy â†’ Vice President of Chapter Operations for Alpha Kappa Psi, I was able
                  to learn many design skills like collaborating, organizing, and problem solving. 
                  <br><br>
                  More recently,
                  I was a Product Designer for Commit the Change and a Lead UX & Product Designer
                  for Koala Skincare.

                <h5 class='about-h5'>Why product design</h5>
                <p class='small-margin-bottom'>
                  During my first 2 years of undergrad, I was set on becoming a software engineer.
                  I envisioned myself bringing a product to life through code. As I began to go deeper
                  into programming, I found that it didn't allow me to be as creative as I would've liked.
                  I often found myself reading documentation rather than creating products themselves. 
                  <br><br>
                  Nearing the end of my 2nd year, I took an intro class about HCI. I learned about product design
                  and how it offers a more direct way to creative problem solving. As I took part in 
                  personal projects and competitions, I found that I loved the process of designing for both 
                  businesses and users. Although I'm grateful for the technical coding skills I learned, I'm
                  glad I discovered product design and proceeded to seek out opportunities to
                  grow my design skills.
                </p>

                <h5 class='about-h5'>My free time</h5>
                <p class='small-margin-bottom'>
                  When I'm not designing, I love being active. Currently, I weightlift for 5 days a week 
                  and play pickup basketball 3 days a week. 
                  <br><br>
                  When I'm not out, I am a huge video gamer. Currently, I play Valorant and my rank is Diamond 2 (top 1% player).
                  I love engaging myself in esports, and would often watch esports tournaments for many games like
                  League of Legends, Valorant, and Apex Legends.

                <h5 class='about-h5'>Problem Solver</h5>
                
                <p class='small-margin-bottom'>I love to tackle design problems head first. I deconstruct each problem 
                  and analyze user pain points for every design problem I approach. By doing so, I make sure that each
                  design decision I make is well-formed and works to solve critical design problems in products. By being 
                  a problem solver, I view failure as knowledge and leverage this knowledge to 
                  iterate and improve upon my design thinking methods. <br><br>
                  I am passionate about UX design because I love the challenge that comes with 
                  solving a design problem. The sense of accomplishment I get when I successfully solve a design problem is 
                  unmatched. I have a desire to learn and grow as I tackle more problems.

                <p class='small-margin-bottom'>As a designer, I love to collaborate with others. I always look forward to
                  insights presented by my peers as a means to grow as a designer. Whether it be collaborating with
                  users, clients, stakeholders, or designers; each and every one of these individuals will provide me with
